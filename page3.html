        <h2>Angular</h2>
        <p> developed by <i>Google</i>, was first released in 2010, making it the oldest of the lot. It is a TypeScript-based JavaScript framework. A substantial shift occurred in 2016 on the release of Angular 2 (and the dropping of the “JS” from the original
            name – AngularJS). Angular 2+ is known as just Angular. Although AngularJS (version 1) still gets updates, we will focus the discussion on Angular. The latest stable version is Angular 11, which was released in November 2020.

        <h2>Vue</h2>
        <p> also known as Vue.js, is the youngest member of the group. It was developed by <i>ex-Google employee Evan You</i> in 2014. Over the last three years, Vue has seen a substantial shift in popularity, even though it doesn’t have the backing of a
            large company. The current stable version is 3.0, released in September 2020 (with some small incremental releases since then). Contributors for Vue are supported by Patreon. It should be noted that Vue 3 is currently in its own GitHub repo,
            and has moved to TypeScript.</p>

        <h2>Syntax details</h2>
        <p>Angular uses TypeScript and splits HTML + TypeScript logic apart, React uses JavaScript and a feature called “JSX” (it combines “HTML” and JavaScript logic), Vue uses regular JavaScript and splits HTML + JavaScript logic apart.</p>
